I am a Portuguese software developer who started experimenting with noise music
a decade ago, currently building a minimalist approach to slow music -
layers of piano, tape loops, found noises, and granular synthesis.

Music for sleeping, most of the time.

{{% warning %}}
This is a static website, and it does not collect any personally identifiable
data on visitors.
However, from time to time I may embed content from other sites which do,
including (but not limited to) Instagram, Twitter, YouTube, and Vimeo.
Even though I have tried to minimise the code pushed by these sites when that
happens, your browser will still load content from them, and that will enable
them to track you (and if you click through to the site, you will of course
be exposed to all of its tracking code).
I have no control over this, and I do not have any access to the data
they collect.
