I figured that every time I update [my Buy Music Club page][my-buy-music]
I should write a few words about each of my picks - this is the first one
of those.

What's this Buy Music Club, you ask?

<!--more-->

In their own words,

> A website for curating and sharing lists of independent music downloads
> available on Bandcamp.

In a nutshell, you [create a page][buy-music] for your recommendations
and paste in a few URLs for music available on Bandcamp - all of this is done
with zero friction. You click a button, add the links, enter a title
and short description (optional, if I recall correctly), and boom,
it's published and you get a password (no username) so that you can edit
the list in the future - save it in your password manager, along with the URL
for your page.

Now is the time to point out you won't get any money for it, and as far as
I can tell neither will the people who run the Buy Music Club. That is not
the point, refreshingly.

Anyway, without further ado, here is my list as of today:

**Duelling Ants - Random Gestures**

  This is so far my favourite album of 2020 - it's beautiful, gentle, happy,
  and has been surprising me every time I play it (that is to say, every day
  since it was released).

**a beautiful burning world - Ambient Piano Pieces Vol II**

  A mere 2 months after the first volume, this is more of the same, and there's
  nothing wrong with that. Subtle, _whispered_ piano pieces lovingly put to tape.

**Amulets - AMULETS / drowse Split**

  Randall Taylor and Kyle Bates _just work_, so you get a cohesion which could
  easily fool you into thinking they have started a band. Maybe they should.
