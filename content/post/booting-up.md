A few months ago, on the 20th anniversary of the word "blog",
Marc Weidenbaum wrote [a post celebrating blogs][disquiet-blogs],
and asked his readers to start a blog.

I used to love blogging, and maintained a few in their heyday. For about 10
years most of my content consumption happened inside a newsreader. But at some
point walled gardens happened, and RSS feeds were shut down with the excuse
users did not want them - nothing to do with _our_ walled garden, honest guv.
At around the same time, I had other demons to deal with, and stopped blogging.
Blogs left my world, both as a reader and a writer.

Reading Marc's post brought back all the fond memories I have from way back
when - and I am very much in tune with his attitude toward content creation,
but more importantly the benefits of blogging he points out completely
resonate.

Demons. Writing in public is, for me, at this point in my life, absolutely terrifying:
I have an insane fear of being judged and being found lacking, of not being
_the best_ - this is a tad problematic. Which is why I have decided to take it
up again; if I have learned anything in the past 10 years or so, it is that if
you do not play, the demons win. And I have won a couple of battles by dint of
attending (yep, sometimes it is that easy).

I am not sure what I will blog about yet - the past couple of years have seen
me getting back to [noodling][noodling], and in a couple of months I will be
playing a live gig for the first time in about 8 years, so there will be
a lot of that - process, tools, snippets, I cannot tell yet. There also seems
to be a steady stream of [Instagram][insta] snapshots - I miss shooting
to a brief, and editing a story down to the the handful of photographs
which told it, but hey - another one to chalk up to the demons. Which probably
means mental health will feature from time to time, if I can muster the will.
I am not sure what else - I have pretty much stopped coding at home unless it
is something to be used for music, and I absolutely refuse to engage in the
toxicity of current politics (two of my favourite subjects, in the past),
so there will not be much of that, if any.
And there is of course the distinct possibility that I will drop this - it is,
after all, an experiment, and it might not work for me.

In any case, my RSS reader has a wealthy dose of subscriptions (many from the
wonderful community at [Lines][llllllll] - reading through the blogging thread
inspired by Marc really pushed me to do this), so it is time to relearn
old habits, and maybe even regain a little bit of self-confidence.
