I once went out with a woman from Arizona.

This EP has been haunting me for 1 year - I wanted to write some stories
to go with the music. I didn't want to go near those memories, though.
In the end, the music is more important.

This has proven to be hard, and I want to release the music.
Once that is out there, the words will be easier to write, who knows.
For the time being those memories are stuck with me, or I am stuck
with them, still.

This was made in VCV Rack, with some piano providing textures to sample.
All the tracks started from a feedback network and a cloud of resonators,
which I then carved up.

Even though they are all part of an arc, I released the first three tracks
on their own, before. But they always belonged together - so [here they are][a-woman-from-arizona].
