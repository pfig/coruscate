**[Jeannine Schulz - Tides][jeannine-schulz]**

  Jeannine Schulz released a slew of albums and tracks in 2020, _Tides_ is the
  latest one. The amount of ambient goodness she packs into just two tracks is
  incredible, you can expect more of her trademark stillness that is always
  reeling you in.

**[tehn - gnostics][tehn]**

  tehn is Brian Crabtree of monome fame. _gnostics_ is the result of 10 years of
  waiting, and is a mix of field recordings, drones, polyrhythms, and what feels
  to me like just sitting and listening to the world go by. A complete surprise
  (as he doesn't release [often][tehn-website]), and the best way to start 2021.

**[Rinnovare - To be in the grey is okay][rinnovare]**

  A single track, _To be in the grey is okay_ is a collaboration between
  Rinnovare and Beno√Æt Pioulard. It's a gentle lullaby that does what it
  says on the tin, and just lets you be.
