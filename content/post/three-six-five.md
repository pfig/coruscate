This is not a 365 days project - I think that is too ambitious
and would set me up for failure. So instead what I am going to do
is _try_ to publish a photo every day for the foreseeable future,
the only rule being it must be a photo taken on that day.

Since I spent some time changing the site's theme and it is now January 9th,
I will be posting the first few photos closely together, but they were taken
on the "right" day. The one above is from January 1st.

Taken in my living room when I realised it was too late to go outside, just as
I decided to start this not-a-365-days-project.
