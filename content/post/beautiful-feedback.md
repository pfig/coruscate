Last night I was fooling around with the [0-COAST][ohcoast], and got stuck
on a very nice loop between the slope and the contour, as you do -
that this is a single voice synth still blows my mind. A slow, gorgeous drone
was coming out of the monitors (almost as if granulated), with the mass of
a thousand Suns. I was very much in the zone, but it was late, and I had
to shut things down.

Luckily I left the [delay pedal][mirage] to last. I was testing how the
octave mode behaved with the continuous growl coming out of the 0-COAST.
When the delay was the only thing left, it was clear the drone had been
blocking something a lot nicer. I increased the decay amount to avoid losing
the signal, and pushed up the send amount on the return channel.
This created a feedback loop with only the delay sound.

Feedback is hard to tame. A tiny increase on one end can bring the whole thing
crashing down (sometimes in a painful way). The Mirage gives you many ways
of controlling it, and at the same time allows for plenty of creativity.
There are several repeat patterns, a tremolo, a swell, and a resonant filter -
you can modulate all these. To top it off, you can add randomness to the volume
of each repeat.

I came back to this the next day, at a more respectable hour (living in
a London flat and all that). I ended up with a proper track out of the process -
it is definitely something I will incorporate in future tracks.

P.S. The next day [Chris Bartels][chris_bartels] asked for interesting ways
to develop a texture or pad, one of the replies was:

{{% blockquote %}}
Add a massive reverb to a track, and render past the end (if the track ends at
bar 40, render to 120). Look in this space for something interesting.
{{% /blockquote %}}

which is similar to what I have done - add effect, cut _main_ sound,
play with what's left of the effect.
