We are on the first week of 2021, and until this week my last post
went live on _checks notes_ February 2020. Then something happened.

Obviously, Covid-19, which is undoubtedly a big part of it - having
all of our plans for the year ruined, being stuck at home for most of
the time, and not seeing friends or family, was, to put it mildly,
devastating. But so far we have managed to evade the virus, which I
count as a big plus - in that respect, we have been lucky (well, that
and cautious).

Despite the struggle to get to grips with constant Zoom calls with 9 people
for issues which would have been solved by 2 people around the coffee machine
in 2 minutes, I gained close to 2 hours in commute time, and that was huge.
(And after a while everyone got into the rhythm of things, and those calls
dwindled down.)

So the first weeks of lockdown #1 were actually fine. I got bored stiff,
and thanks to that and the extra time tried new creative outlets - painting
and alternative photographic processes.

When we got to the end of the year, I had released [5 EPs and 1 single][straywool-bc],
which was definitely not in the plans.

But at some point something cracked, and even though I was being productive,
I had lost something. The blog and the enthusiasm for it were some of the
things that went it that. There's no great tragedy behind it, just... emptiness.
And consequently, there is no redeeming arc, I am writing now because I
decided to try and see what comes of it, that's it. So let's see.

Onward and upward, to infinity and beyond, etc.
